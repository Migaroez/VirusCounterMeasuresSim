# VirusCounterMeasuresSim
A sim to show how important it can be to follow (all) guidelines when fighting a pandemic.

# Documentation
Hopefully to come, in the meantime have a look at the [Desing Document](https://github.com/Migaroez/VirusCounterMeasuresSim/blob/main/Design%20Document.md)

# Contributing
Currently not taking any contributions as the project is still starting up and the architecture is still being fleshed out.
